        <p>Kiryu Moeka is a part-time editor whom <a href="./okabe.html">Okabe Rintaro</a> encounters in Akiba.</p>
        <p>She is practically glued to her phone and cannot function without it.</p>
        <p>Even when face to face, Moeka prefers to communicate by email, to the point where if her phone is taken away, she will almost refuse to speak until her phone is returned.</p>
